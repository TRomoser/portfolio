      <p className="paragraph">GetTogether is a Full-stack, full CRUD web application that we 
        (a team of three web developers) desigend to bring individuals 
        closer to their community by making it easy to organize local 
        and affordable events for all ages. We created GetTogether using 
        the concept of 'mob programming,' Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and 
        DTL, and Heroku for deployment. The app allows visitors to sign 
        up or login, view events in three different cities, create events 
        in any of those cities, comment on past and upcoming events, and 
        rate past events. Our team's mission was to create a 
        community-centric app that makes finding events and putting on 
        events simple and fun. We should GetTogether!
